energy including higher power and longer duration time terminaltumorthermal ablation would release tumorrelatedneoantigen to blood circulation eventually induce a systemic reaction this reaction is

lead to a false negativein cytokine detection to the research about adenomyosis on the other hand experiment design was determined to followup the il6 at  months afterhifu ablation as our data

regression of the socalled \\u00c2\\u009cabscopal effect\\u00c2\\u009don distant tumors the incidence rate of such an effect israre probably due to uncontested immunological activation caused by one ablation treatment and the lack ofimmuneamplification management in  it was described that in situ tumor destruction can provide a useful antigen source forthe induction of antitumorimmunity   however clinical studies could not sufficiently utilize such an effect until the development ofimmune checkpoint inhibitors icis [ ] icis suchas pd1pdl1 and ctla4 antibodies are widely applied in several cancers and studies have indicated thatici treatment could enhance the effect of ablation  evidence indicates that hyperthermic destruction causesthe release of a large population of heterogeneous tumorantigens and inflammatory cytokines may play crucialroles in this process   however opposite evidence indicated that incomplete radiofrequency ablation couldinduce inflammation which may accelerates tumor progression and hinders pd1 immunotherapy   suggesting that ablation treatment may promote tumorprogression our data demonstrated that il6 was significantly increased after mwa treatment il6 is derived from monocytes macrophages dcs th2 cells andsometimes cancer cells and it plays a key role in t cellproliferation and survival   the role of il6 appearsto be rather complex korn classified il6 as \\u00c2\\u009cdifferentiation factor\\u00c2\\u009d which could involve in differentiation ofth17 cells   however il6 does not direct the commitment to the th1 or th2 cell lineage but controls theproliferation and survival of immunocytes cooperatingwith other cytokines such as tgf tnf or il21  for instance il6 activated stat3 pathway in naivecd4 t cells in the presence of the morphogen tgfbpromotes the population expansion of th17 cells   recent evidence indicates that il6 plays an indispensable role in t cellinfiltration to the tumor sitewhich could benefit immunomodulatory therapy   incontrast il6 can increase mdscs   inhibit the development and maturation of dendritic cells dcs  and inhibit the polarization of th1 cells   eventuallyresulting in

and systemic effects of thermal ablation il6 knockout via a nanop antiil6 sirna in mice coulddecrease the local vegf level at the ablation site  therefore how to utilize the positive effect of il6 whileavoiding the negative effect after mwa needs further investigation preclinical research indicated that il6 andpdl1 blockade combination therapy reduced tumorprogression in animal models [ ] thus an antiil strategy after ablation should be considered whencombined with ici therapy previous studies and ourshave demonstrated that most cytokine levels returned topretreatment levels  days after

the  first  to  explore  tnfaip8 variants and susceptibility in oc however it has come limitations  for  example  the  followup  period  was  not sufficiently  long  and  our  study  was

risk  of oc  in  heilongjiang  province  of  china  however  the gg allele of tnfaip8 in the two genotypes played the opposite roles in the risk of oc furthermore we found that tnfaip8 rs1045242 polymorphism had an effect on clinical  significance  of  figo  stage  residual  tumor  and recurrence  indicating  its  progressive  role  in  oc  yet there  are  some  limitations  and  shortcomings  whether tnfaip8 rs1045242 polymorphism affected the protein expression  status  and  its  effect  on  prognosis  remain  to unclear it is wellknown that the inherited mutations of brca1 and brca2

\\u00c2\\u0093 of cancerrelateddeaths worldwide [ ] squamous carcinoma is themost common type of cervical carcinoma followed byadenocarcinoma nevertheless overthreedecades a significant increase in adenocarcinoma caseshas been observed in many developed countries especiallyin younger women   papsmear screening also knownas pap test is still considered the main screening methodfor cervical cancer especially for squamous carcinoma  compared to squamous carcinoma the adenocarcinomaof the cervix is more common in younger women and hasa poorer prognosis   therapeutic approaches includechemoradiotherapy ccrt which has been proven tobe effective for squamous carcinoma of the cervix but notfor adenocarcinoma of the cervix   due to its highchemo and radioresistance   therefore differentiatingadenocarcinoma from squamous carcinoma is importantin order to provide patients with most suitable therapyp63 p40 and cytokeratin 56ck56 are the mostcommon panel ofimmunochemical markers for thediagnosis of squamous carcinoma   p63 and ck56are traditional markers that indicate squamous differentiation   in primary lung neoplasms most squamouscarcinomas and large cell carcinomas are positive forck56   warth   found that the probability of acorrect sqcc diagnosis using ck56 is   p63 a transcriptional regulator has a crucial role in thedevelopment and differentiation of stratified squamousepithelium it is usually strongly expressed in the basalkeratinocytes [\\u00c2\\u0093] vosmik   analyzed  patientswith cervical squamous cell carcinoma and found that  had positive expression of p63  p40 is a new specific marker for distinguishing squamouscarcinomas from adenocarcinoma whose specificity isabout  in lung carcinomas however the positiveexpression of ck56 p63 and p40 are only found in a fewadenocarcinomas [ ] kriegsmann   suggested theuse of either ck56 or p40 over p63 in the routine diagnostic setting   ck7 is expressed in many ductal andglandular epithelial cells mainly gallbladder hepatic ductsand pancreatic ducts in tissues of the female genital tractovary endometrium fallopian tube and cervix and in thebreast lung and urinary tract tissues   in the normalcervical tissue and adenocarcinoma ck7 staining wasobserved in the columnar cells of endocervical glandshashiguchi   found the different rates of ck7 in patientswith cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and those with invasivecarcinomas  vs  [ ] thus far no efficientmarkers have been developed for distinguishing squamouscell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in the endocervixmucins are a family of large glycoproteins expressedon the epithelial cell surfaces including ducts of lacrimalglands in the eye salivary glands the lining of the respiratory gastrointestinal urothelial and reproductive tracts  muc5ac belongs to gelforming mucins   multiple histological studies have highlighted that muc5acis expressed in the conjunctiva middle ear nasopharynxlungs gallbladder and stomach under normal conditionswhere it provides protection to corresponding epithelialsurfaces from different factors   some research hasshown that muc5ac may be a potential biomarker inpancreatic cancer tissues   dimaio   found thatanterior gradient homolog  and muc5ac are usefulpositive markers of adenocarcinoma in the setting ofabsent or diminished p63 and cytokeratin  staining inesophageal carcinoma   it is also expressed in theendocervix yamanoi  found that muc5ac waslargely expressed in typical legh atypical legh gasmda and gasnonmda   thus we speculated thatmuc5ac could be expressed in other adenocarcinomasand might be used for the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma the aim of thisstudy was to examine the

epithelial cells in the respiratory tractgastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract which has animportant role in the protection of epithelium cell adhesion signal transduction immune activation and inhibition at present at least  mucins have been found inthe female reproductive system   riethdorf    and albarracin     used immunohistochemistrymethods to detect the expression of muc5ac in different female reproductive system malignant tumors theyfound that muc5ac was highly expressed in cervicaladenocarcinoma   and poorly expressed inendometrial adenocarcinoma   all of themwere expressed in the primary ovarian mucinous tumor  but not in colon adenocarcinoma   therefore they concluded that muc5ac could beused as an effective marker to distinguish the origin ofpelvic tumors and distinguish primary ovarian tumorsand colorectal metastasis as well as endometrial adenocarcinoma from cervical metastasis [ ] in thisstudy we found positive expression of muc5ac in   cases of cervical adenocarcinoma and in  cases of squamous carcinoma which wasconsistent with riethdorf\\u00c2\\u0099s study   the sensitivity ofmuc5ac and ck7 to cervical adenocarcinoma was and  respectively

of muc5ac combined with p40 or p63was similar to that of ck7 butthe specificity wasslightly higher than that of ck7 therefore muc5ac issuperior to ck7 in the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomabesides we preliminarily detected the expression ofmuc5ac in different types of cervical adenocarcinomaand found no significant difference these data suggestedthat muc5ac has no diagnostic significance in the classification of cervical adenocarcinoma at the same time weanalyzed the relationship between the expression ofmuc5ac and the prognosis of cervical adenocarcinomaand the result revealed that muc5ac was not related tothe prognosis of cervical adenocarcinomaoverall our observations strongly suggest that muc5acmay be useful as a biomarker for differential

sufficiently utilize such an effect until the development ofimmune checkpoint inhibitors icis [ ] icis suchas pd1pdl1 and ctla4 antibodies are widely applied in several cancers and studies have indicated thatici treatment could enhance the effect of ablation  evidence indicates that hyperthermic destruction causesthe release of a large population of heterogeneous tumorantigens and

as \\u00c2\\u009cdifferentiation factor\\u00c2\\u009d which could involve in differentiation ofth17 cells   however il6 does not direct the commitment to the th1 or th2 cell lineage but controls theproliferation and survival of immunocytes cooperatingwith other cytokines such as tgf tnf or il21  for instance il6 activated stat3 pathway in naivecd4 t cells in the presence of the morphogen tgfbpromotes the population expansion of th17 cells   recent evidence indicates that il6 plays an indispensable role in t cellinfiltration to the tumor sitewhich could benefit immunomodulatory therapy   incontrast il6 can increase mdscs   inhibit the development and maturation of dendritic cells dcs  and inhibit the polarization of th1 cells   eventuallyresulting in negative immunomodulatory effects according to muneeb ahmed\\u00c2\\u0099s work the adjuvant uses ofa nanop smallinterfering rna sirna can besuccessfully used to target the il6mediated locoregional and systemic effects of thermal ablation il6 knockout via a nanop antiil6 sirna in mice coulddecrease the local vegf level at the ablation site  therefore how to utilize the positive effect of il6 whileavoiding the negative effect after mwa needs further investigation preclinical research indicated that il6 andpdl1 blockade combination therapy reduced tumorprogression in animal models [ ] thus an antiil strategy after ablation should be considered whencombined with ici therapy previous studies and ourshave demonstrated that most cytokine levels returned topretreatment levels  days after ablation this resultsuggests that  h to  days after ablation may be optimal timing for additional immunomodulatory therapysour results reported here support the evidence for terminal tumor thermal ablation could cause heat injury totissues surrounding the tumor site and release neoantigento blood circulation eventually induce a systemic reactionthis reaction could lead to a detectable alteration of cytokine levels further

associated  with  increased  risk  compared with controls however our present research found that the g allele and gg allele of tnfaip8 rs11064 both played a reduced role in risk of oc aor   ci \\u00c2\\u0093 for g allele and aor   ci \\u00c2\\u0093 for gg allele the discordance of the above findings may be explained by that the effect of genetic factors often differs in different individualsno  considerable  relationship  between  tnfaip8 rs1045241  and  oc  risk  was  identified  in  our  present paper additionally our previous study in ec had been in  accordance  with  this  result     searching  from  the literature  data  tnfaip8  rs1045241  polymorphism  was reported to have clinical significance in no other reports except that in nhl zhang et a0al   demonstrated that the  polymorphism  of  tnfaip8  rs1045241  may  lead  to nhl susceptibility in a chinese population we believe that  the  related  role  of  environmental  factors  may  not be  ignored  so  far  no  literature  except  our  team  has reported  the  relationship  between  tnfaip8  rs1045242 polymorphism  and  tumor  our  results  showed  that tnfaip8 rs1045242 g allele carriers showed increased risk of oc by  times compared to the a allele carriers also the ag  gg genotype of tnfaip8 rs1045242 increased    times  risks  of  oc  compared  with  aa genotype  these  findings  were  consistent  with  previous  study  in  ec     the  above  provide  evidence  that tnfaip8  rs1045242  polymorphism  may  involve  in  the onset of gynecological malignancybesides  subgroup  analysis  revealed  that  tnfaip8 rs1045242  polymorphism  increased  the  risk  of  oc  in patients  with  age  \\u00c2\\u0089  a0 years  old  smoking  history  no complication  and  no  family  cancer  history  uncovering  that  individuals  exposed  to  these  factors  are  more susceptible to oc in patients with no smoking history and no family cancer history the gg allele of tnfaip8 rs11064  snps  played  a  protective  factor  for  oc  however  the  underlying  mechanism  that  the  same  genotype  performs  opposite  effects  in  different  tumor  types remains to be illuminatedmoreover  we  explored  the  connection  between  the tnfaip8 genes polymorphism and clinical variables of oc  we  suggested  that  tnfaip8  genes  polymorphism rs11064  rs1045241  and  rs1045242  were  significantly connected  with  figo  stage  in  addition  tnfaip8 rs1045242  polymorphism  was  also  strongly  associated with  residual  tumor  and  recurrence  indicating  its  role of progression in oc for rs11064 it was reported that it positively linked to deep myometrial invasion and lymph node  metastasis  under  the  codominant  model  in  ecs   in cervical cancer it attempted to explore the relationship between tnfaip8 rs11064 polymorphism and drug resistance but with no sense   the association between tnfaip8 rs1045242 polymorphism and stage in nhl was observed  the  present  study  is  the  first  to  explore  tnfaip8 variants and susceptibility in oc however it has come limitations  for  example  the  followup  period  was  not sufficiently  long  and  our  study  was  retrospective  and included  a  relatively  small  number  of  chinese  patients form  a  single  center  thus  future  examination  of  large sample  size  and  multiple  centers  are  needed  to  verify genotype\\u00c2\\u0093phenotype  associations  and  functional  analysis for tnfaip8 snpthis study suggests that tnfaip8 rs11064 and rs1045242 polymorphisms  are  remarkably  linked  with  the  risk  of oc  in  heilongjiang  province  of  china  however  the gg allele of tnfaip8 in the two genotypes played the opposite roles in the risk of oc furthermore we found that tnfaip8 rs1045242 polymorphism had an effect on clinical  significance  of  figo  stage  residual  tumor  and recurrence  indicating  its  progressive  role  in  oc  yet there  are  some  limitations  and  shortcomings  whether tnfaip8 rs1045242 polymorphism affected the protein expression  status  and  its  effect  on  prognosis  remain  to unclear it is wellknown that the inherited mutations of brca1 and brca2 genes resulted in hereditary breast and  ovarian  cancer  syndrome  hboc  however  there are  only    of    oc  patients  have  oc  family  history and only  of  oc patients have hboc in the present case\\u00c2\\u0093control study thus welldesigned larger including patients with hboc and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer hnpcc prospective study with functional analysis is an interesting

adenocarcinoma caseshas been observed in many developed countries especiallyin younger women   papsmear screening also knownas pap test is still considered the main screening methodfor cervical cancer especially for squamous carcinoma  compared to squamous carcinoma the adenocarcinomaof the cervix is more common in younger women and hasa poorer prognosis   therapeutic approaches includechemoradiotherapy ccrt which has been proven tobe effective for squamous carcinoma of the cervix but notfor adenocarcinoma of the cervix   due to its highchemo and radioresistance   therefore differentiatingadenocarcinoma from squamous carcinoma is importantin order to provide patients with most suitable therapyp63 p40 and cytokeratin 56ck56 are the mostcommon panel ofimmunochemical markers for thediagnosis of squamous carcinoma   p63 and ck56are traditional markers that indicate squamous differentiation   in primary lung neoplasms most squamouscarcinomas and large cell carcinomas are positive forck56   warth   found that the probability of acorrect sqcc diagnosis using ck56 is   p63 a transcriptional regulator has a crucial role in thedevelopment and differentiation of stratified squamousepithelium it is usually strongly expressed in the basalkeratinocytes [\\u00c2\\u0093] vosmik   analyzed  patientswith cervical squamous cell carcinoma and found that  had positive expression of p63  p40 is a new specific marker for distinguishing squamouscarcinomas from adenocarcinoma whose specificity isabout  in lung carcinomas however the positiveexpression of ck56 p63 and p40 are only found in a fewadenocarcinomas [ ] kriegsmann   suggested theuse of either ck56 or p40 over p63 in the routine diagnostic setting   ck7 is expressed in many ductal andglandular epithelial cells mainly gallbladder hepatic ductsand pancreatic ducts in tissues of the female genital tractovary endometrium fallopian tube and cervix and in thebreast lung and urinary tract tissues

endocervixmucins are a family of large glycoproteins expressedon the epithelial cell surfaces including ducts of lacrimalglands in the eye salivary glands the lining of the respiratory gastrointestinal urothelial and reproductive tracts  muc5ac belongs to gelforming mucins   multiple histological studies have highlighted that muc5acis expressed in the conjunctiva middle ear nasopharynxlungs gallbladder and stomach under normal conditionswhere it provides protection to corresponding epithelialsurfaces from different factors   some research hasshown that muc5ac may be a

cytokeratin  staining inesophageal carcinoma   it is also expressed in theendocervix yamanoi  found that muc5ac waslargely expressed in typical legh atypical legh gasmda and gasnonmda   thus we speculated thatmuc5ac could be expressed in other adenocarcinomasand might be used for the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma the aim of thisstudy was to examine the

andspecificity of p63 were  and  respectivelythe sensitivity and specificity of p40 in the diagnosis ofsquamous cell carcinoma of the lung were  and respectively   therefore p40 is considered as ahighly specific and sensitive tumor biomarker of squamous epithelial origin  in this study we used immunohistochemistry to detectck56 p63 and p40 in cervical squamous cell carcinomaand adenocarcinoma the sensitivity of ck56 p40 andp63 was   and  respectively and thespecificity was   and  respectivelymoreover the specificity of ck56 is slightly lower thanthat of p40 and p63 we also found that a combinationof ck56 with p40 or p63 slightly decreased the sensitivity  and  and increased the specificity and  which in turn increased the accuracy of diagnosing squamous cell carcinomack7 is a kind

carcinoma suggest poor tumor differentiation and thus canbe used as an independent prognostic factor   ourstudy showed that the positive rate of ck7 was  incervical poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinomawhich further suggested that ck7 is not an ideal markerfor differentiation between squamous cell carcinoma andadenocarcinomamucin is a high molecular weight glycosylated proteinsecreted by epithelial cells in the respiratory tractgastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract which has animportant role in the protection of epithelium cell adhesion signal transduction immune activation and inhibition at present at least  mucins have been found inthe female reproductive system   riethdorf    and albarracin     used immunohistochemistrymethods to detect the expression of muc5ac in different female reproductive system malignant tumors theyfound that muc5ac was highly expressed in cervicaladenocarcinoma   and poorly expressed inendometrial adenocarcinoma   all of themwere expressed in the primary ovarian mucinous tumor  but not in colon adenocarcinoma   therefore they concluded that muc5ac could beused as an effective marker to distinguish the origin ofpelvic tumors and distinguish primary ovarian tumorsand colorectal metastasis as well as endometrial adenocarcinoma from cervical metastasis [ ] in thisstudy we found positive expression of muc5ac in   cases of cervical adenocarcinoma and in  cases of squamous carcinoma which wasconsistent with riethdorf\\u00c2\\u0099s study   the sensitivity ofmuc5ac and ck7 to cervical adenocarcinoma was and  respectively but the specificity ofmuc5ac  was much higher than that of ck7 through the joint detection of p40 or p63 wecompared muc5ac and ck7 again and found that thesensitivity and specificity of muc5ac combined withp40 or p63 were  and  respectively and  respectively the sensitivity and specificity ofck7 combined with p40 or p63 were  and  and  respectively these results showed thatthe sensitivity of muc5ac combined with p40 or p63was similar to that of ck7 butthe specificity wasslightly higher than that of ck7 therefore muc5ac issuperior to ck7 in the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomabesides we preliminarily detected the expression ofmuc5ac in different types of cervical adenocarcinomaand found no significant difference these data suggestedthat muc5ac has no diagnostic significance in the classification of cervical adenocarcinoma at the same time weanalyzed the relationship between the expression ofmuc5ac and the prognosis of cervical adenocarcinomaand the result revealed that muc5ac was not related tothe prognosis of cervical adenocarcinomaoverall our observations strongly suggest that muc5acmay be useful as a biomarker for differential

reactions are more complicatedand could affect more immunocytes [ ] which wouldmake this process last longer than other reactions theseexplanations may be the reason why the cytokine changeslasted

ablation operation design to receive a terminal ablation larger tumor would cost higher energy including higher power and longer duration time terminaltumorthermal ablation would release

about adenomyosis on the other hand experiment design was determined to followup the il6 at  months afterhifu ablation as our data demonstrated mostly cytokines were return to premwa level after

ablationinduced systemic effects suchasresponse haveattracted increased attention   de baere t first reported two cases of spontaneous regression of multiplepulmonary metastases occurring after

effect\\u00c2\\u009don distant tumors the incidence rate of such an effect israre probably due to uncontested immunological activation caused by one ablation treatment and the lack ofimmuneamplification management in  it was described that in situ tumor destruction can provide a useful antigen source forthe induction of antitumorimmunity   however clinical studies could not sufficiently utilize such an effect until the development ofimmune checkpoint inhibitors icis [ ] icis suchas pd1pdl1 and ctla4 antibodies are widely applied in several cancers and studies have indicated thatici treatment could enhance the effect of ablation  evidence indicates that hyperthermic destruction causesthe release of a large population of heterogeneous tumorantigens and inflammatory cytokines may play crucialroles in this process   however opposite evidence indicated that incomplete radiofrequency ablation couldinduce inflammation which may accelerates tumor progression and hinders pd1 immunotherapy   suggesting that ablation treatment may promote tumorprogression our data demonstrated that il6 was significantly increased after mwa treatment il6 is derived from monocytes macrophages dcs th2 cells andsometimes cancer cells and it plays a key role in t cellproliferation and survival   the role of il6 appearsto be rather complex korn classified il6 as \\u00c2\\u009cdifferentiation factor\\u00c2\\u009d which could involve in differentiation ofth17 cells   however il6 does not direct the commitment to the th1 or th2 cell lineage but controls theproliferation and survival of immunocytes cooperatingwith other cytokines such as tgf tnf or il21  for instance il6 activated stat3 pathway in naivecd4 t cells in the presence of the morphogen tgfbpromotes the population expansion of th17 cells   recent evidence indicates that il6 plays an indispensable role in t cellinfiltration to the tumor sitewhich could benefit immunomodulatory therapy   incontrast il6 can increase mdscs   inhibit the development and maturation of dendritic cells dcs  and inhibit the polarization of th1 cells   eventuallyresulting in negative immunomodulatory

effect after mwa needs further investigation preclinical research indicated that il6 andpdl1 blockade combination therapy reduced tumorprogression in animal models [ ] thus an antiil strategy after ablation should be considered whencombined with ici therapy previous studies and ourshave demonstrated that most cytokine levels returned topretreatment levels  days after ablation this resultsuggests that  h to  days after ablation may be optimal timing for additional immunomodulatory therapysour results reported here support the evidence for terminal tumor thermal ablation could cause heat injury

\\u00c2\\u0093 of cancerrelateddeaths worldwide [ ] squamous carcinoma is themost common type of cervical carcinoma followed byadenocarcinoma nevertheless overthreedecades a significant increase in adenocarcinoma caseshas been observed in many developed countries especiallyin younger women   papsmear screening also knownas pap test is still considered the main screening methodfor cervical cancer especially for squamous carcinoma  compared to squamous carcinoma the adenocarcinomaof the cervix is more common in younger women and hasa poorer prognosis   therapeutic approaches includechemoradiotherapy ccrt which has been proven tobe effective for squamous carcinoma of the cervix but notfor adenocarcinoma of the cervix   due to its highchemo and radioresistance   therefore differentiatingadenocarcinoma from squamous carcinoma is importantin order to provide patients with most suitable therapyp63 p40 and cytokeratin 56ck56 are the mostcommon panel ofimmunochemical markers for thediagnosis of squamous carcinoma   p63 and ck56are traditional markers that indicate squamous differentiation   in primary lung neoplasms most squamouscarcinomas and large cell carcinomas are positive forck56   warth   found that the probability of acorrect sqcc diagnosis using ck56 is   p63 a transcriptional regulator has a crucial role in thedevelopment and differentiation of stratified squamousepithelium it is usually strongly expressed in the basalkeratinocytes [\\u00c2\\u0093] vosmik   analyzed  patientswith cervical squamous cell carcinoma and found that  had positive expression of p63  p40 is a new specific marker for distinguishing squamouscarcinomas from adenocarcinoma whose specificity isabout  in lung carcinomas however the positiveexpression of ck56 p63 and p40 are only found in a fewadenocarcinomas [ ] kriegsmann   suggested theuse of either ck56 or p40 over p63 in the routine diagnostic setting   ck7 is expressed in many ductal andglandular epithelial cells mainly gallbladder hepatic ductsand pancreatic ducts in tissues of the female genital tractovary endometrium fallopian tube and cervix and in thebreast lung and urinary tract tissues   in the normalcervical tissue and adenocarcinoma ck7 staining wasobserved in the columnar cells of endocervical glandshashiguchi   found the different rates of ck7 in patientswith cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and those with invasivecarcinomas  vs  [ ] thus far no efficientmarkers have been developed for distinguishing squamouscell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in the endocervixmucins are a family of large glycoproteins expressedon the epithelial cell surfaces including ducts of lacrimalglands in the eye salivary glands the lining of the respiratory gastrointestinal urothelial and reproductive tracts  muc5ac belongs to gelforming mucins   multiple histological studies have highlighted that muc5acis expressed in the conjunctiva middle ear nasopharynxlungs gallbladder and stomach under normal conditionswhere it provides protection to corresponding epithelialsurfaces from different factors   some research hasshown that muc5ac may be a potential biomarker inpancreatic cancer tissues   dimaio   found thatanterior gradient homolog  and muc5ac are usefulpositive markers of adenocarcinoma in the setting ofabsent or diminished p63 and cytokeratin  staining inesophageal carcinoma   it is also expressed in theendocervix yamanoi  found that muc5ac waslargely expressed in typical legh atypical legh gasmda and gasnonmda   thus we speculated thatmuc5ac could be expressed in other adenocarcinomasand might be used for the differential diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma the aim of thisstudy was to examine the

epithelial cells in the respiratory tractgastrointestinal tract and urogenital tract which has animportant role in the protection of epithelium cell adhesion signal transduction immune activation and inhibition at present at least  mucins have been found inthe female reproductive system   riethdorf    and albarracin     used immunohistochemistrymethods to detect the expression of muc5ac in different female reproductive system malignant tumors theyfound that muc5ac was highly expressed in cervicaladenocarcinoma   and poorly expressed inendometrial adenocarcinoma   all of themwere expressed in the primary ovarian mucinous tumor  but not in colon adenocarcinoma   therefore they concluded that muc5ac could beused as an effective marker to distinguish the origin ofpelvic tumors and distinguish primary ovarian tumorsand colorectal metastasis as well as endometrial adenocarcinoma from cervical metastasis [ ] in thisstudy we found positive expression of muc5ac in   cases of cervical adenocarcinoma and in  cases of squamous carcinoma which wasconsistent with riethdorf\\u00c2\\u0099s study   the sensitivity ofmuc5ac and ck7 to cervical adenocarcinoma was and  respectively but the specificity ofmuc5ac  was much higher than that of ck7 through the joint detection of p40 or p63 wecompared muc5ac and ck7 again and found that thesensitivity and specificity of muc5ac

of muc5ac combined with p40 or p63was similar to that of ck7 butthe specificity wasslightly higher than that of ck7 therefore muc5ac issuperior to ck7 in the diagnosis of cervical adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinomabesides we preliminarily detected the expression ofmuc5ac in different types of cervical adenocarcinomaand found no significant difference these data suggestedthat muc5ac has no diagnostic significance in the classification of cervical adenocarcinoma at the same time weanalyzed the relationship between the expression ofmuc5ac and the prognosis of cervical adenocarcinomaand

nonspecific and specific reactions generally cytokines affectedby wound healingimmunologicalreactions do not last longer than those affected by specificimmunologicalreactions ablation treatmentinducedspecific immunological reactions are more complicatedand could affect more immunocytes which wouldmake this process last longer than other reactions theseexplanations may be the reason why the cytokine changeslasted different durations moreover cytokines affected bythe second manner would be positively correlated withthe ablation scale which is why we employed the \\u00e2

would release tumorrelatedneoantigen to blood circulation eventually induce a systemic reaction this reaction is dependent on the scale ofthermal injury and the local immunological microenvironment of the tumor our findings indicated that il andil were significantly altered after the ablation procedureand positively correlated with mwa energy il is commonly derived from activated t cells primarily th cellsil can stimulate t cells to proliferate and differentiateactivate natural killer nk cells and macrophages and enhance the functions of cytotoxic t lymphocytes ctls our data illustrated that il

mwa could releasefragment of cancer cells into blood as neoantigen macrophages could response to this proceed and cause a systemic immunoreaction additional cytokines alterationsuch as il after

located in lung liver orsoft tissues increases plasma levels of il and il another question remain unveiled was if our result was\\u00e2 cancerspecific\\u00e2 we checked literature about cytokinemodulation after thermal ablation in benign diseases andonly got limit evidences based on benign thyroid nodules and adenomyosis according to these literatureil levels did not show any significant difference aftertreatment compared with pretreatment values indicatingthat elevation of il may be caused by tumour antigenreleased by ablation treatment however the ablationenergy used in thyroid nodules was much lower thanliver and lung which would lead to a false negativein cytokine detection to the research about adenomyosis on the other hand experiment design was determined to followup the il at months afterhifu ablation as our data demonstrated mostly cytokines were return to premwa level after monthdetection after months may miss the modulation ofil overall few evidences support that some of thecytokines were altered in a \\u00e2 cancerspecific\\u00e2 mannerwhile no solid results could confirm that further animal experiments were required to make a clarifieddata and answer this question czhao bmc cancer page of thetumorassociated immunein recent years ablationinduced systemic effects suchasresponse haveattracted increased attention de baere t first reported two cases of spontaneous regression of multiplepulmonary metastases occurring after radiofrequencyablation of a single lung metastasis although growing evidence suggests that thermal ablation can inducespontaneous regression of the socalled \\u00e2 abscopal effect\\u00e2 on distant tumors the incidence rate of such an effect israre probably due to uncontested immunological activation caused by one ablation treatment and the lack ofimmuneamplification management in it was described that in situ tumor destruction can provide a useful antigen source forthe induction of antitumorimmunity however clinical studies could not sufficiently utilize such an effect until the development ofimmune checkpoint inhibitors icis icis suchas pdpdl and ctla antibodies are widely applied in several cancers and studies have indicated thatici treatment could enhance the effect of ablation evidence indicates that hyperthermic destruction causesthe release of a large population of heterogeneous tumorantigens and inflammatory cytokines may play crucialroles in this process however opposite evidence indicated that incomplete radiofrequency ablation couldinduce inflammation which may accelerates tumor progression and hinders pd immunotherapy suggesting that ablation treatment may promote tumorprogression our data demonstrated that il was significantly increased after mwa treatment il is derived from monocytes macrophages dcs th cells andsometimes cancer cells and it plays a key role in t cellproliferation and survival the role of il appearsto be rather complex korn classified il as \\u00e2 differentiation factor\\u00e2 which could involve in differentiation ofth cells however il does not direct the commitment to the th or th cell lineage but controls theproliferation and survival of immunocytes cooperatingwith other cytokines such as tgf tnf or il for instance il activated stat pathway in naivecd t cells in the presence of the morphogen tgfbpromotes the population expansion of th cells recent evidence indicates that il plays an indispensable role in t cellinfiltration to the tumor sitewhich could benefit immunomodulatory therapy incontrast il can increase mdscs inhibit the development and maturation of dendritic cells dcs and inhibit the polarization of th cells eventuallyresulting in negative immunomodulatory effects according to muneeb ahmed\\u00e2 s work the adjuvant uses ofa nanop smallinterfering rna sirna can besuccessfully used to target the ilmediated locoregional and systemic effects of thermal ablation il knockout via a nanop antiil sirna in mice coulddecrease the local vegf level at the ablation site therefore how to utilize the positive effect of il whileavoiding the negative effect after mwa needs further investigation preclinical research indicated that il andpdl blockade combination therapy reduced tumorprogression in animal models thus an antiil strategy after ablation should be considered whencombined with ici therapy previous studies and ourshave demonstrated that most cytokine levels returned topretreatment levels days after ablation this resultsuggests that h to days after ablation may be optimal timing for additional immunomodulatory therapysour results reported here support the evidence for terminal tumor thermal ablation could cause heat injury totissues surrounding the tumor site and release

elevated risk compared with aaag genotypes furthermore the study of endometrial cancer ec showed that the gg genotype and ag gg genotype of tnfaip rs were both associated with increased risk compared with controls however our present research found that the g allele and gg allele of tnfaip rs both played a reduced role in risk of oc aor ci \\u00e2 for g allele and aor ci \\u00e2 for gg allele the discordance of the above findings may be explained by that the effect of genetic factors often differs in different individualsno considerable relationship between tnfaip rs and oc risk was identified in our present paper additionally our previous study in ec had been in accordance with this result searching from the literature data tnfaip rs polymorphism was reported to have clinical significance in no other reports except that in nhl zhang et aal demonstrated that the polymorphism of tnfaip rs may lead to nhl susceptibility in a chinese population we believe that the related role of environmental factors may not be ignored so far no literature except our team has reported the relationship between tnfaip rs polymorphism and tumor our results showed that tnfaip rs g allele carriers showed increased risk of oc by times compared to the a allele carriers also the ag gg genotype of tnfaip rs increased times risks of oc compared with aa genotype these findings were consistent with previous study in ec the above provide evidence that tnfaip rs polymorphism may involve in the onset of gynecological malignancybesides subgroup analysis revealed that tnfaip rs polymorphism increased the risk of oc in patients with age \\u00e2 a years old smoking history no complication and no family cancer history uncovering that individuals exposed to these factors are more susceptible to oc in patients with no smoking history and no family cancer history the gg allele of tnfaip rs snps played a protective factor for oc however the underlying mechanism that the same genotype performs opposite effects in different tumor types remains to be illuminatedmoreover we explored the connection between the tnfaip genes polymorphism and clinical variables of oc we suggested that tnfaip genes polymorphism rs rs and rs were significantly connected with figo stage in addition tnfaip rs polymorphism was also strongly associated with residual tumor and recurrence indicating its role of progression in oc for rs it was reported that it positively linked to deep myometrial invasion and lymph node metastasis under the codominant model in ecs in cervical cancer it attempted to explore the relationship between tnfaip rs polymorphism and drug resistance but with no sense the association between tnfaip rs polymorphism and stage in nhl was observed the present study is the first to explore tnfaip variants and susceptibility in oc however it has come limitations for example the followup period was not sufficiently long and our study was retrospective and included a relatively small number of chinese patients form a single center thus future examination of large sample size and multiple centers are needed to verify genotype\\u00e2 phenotype associations and functional analysis for tnfaip snpthis study suggests that tnfaip rs and rs polymorphisms are remarkably linked with the risk of oc in heilongjiang province of china however the gg allele of tnfaip in the two genotypes played the opposite roles in the risk of oc furthermore we found that tnfaip rs polymorphism had an effect on clinical significance of figo stage residual tumor and recurrence indicating its progressive role in oc yet there are some limitations and shortcomings whether tnfaip rs polymorphism affected the protein expression status and its effect on prognosis remain to unclear it is wellknown that the inherited mutations of brca and brca genes resulted in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome hboc however there are only of oc patients have oc family history and only of oc patients have hboc in the present case\\u00e2 control study thus welldesigned larger including patients with hboc and hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer hnpcc prospective study with functional

cancerrelateddeaths worldwide squamous carcinoma is themost common type of cervical carcinoma followed byadenocarcinoma nevertheless overthreedecades a significant increase in adenocarcinoma caseshas been observed in many developed countries especiallyin younger women papsmear screening also knownas pap test is still considered the main screening methodfor cervical cancer especially for squamous carcinoma compared to squamous carcinoma the adenocarcinomaof the cervix is more common in younger women and hasa poorer prognosis therapeutic approaches includechemoradiotherapy ccrt which has been proven tobe effective for squamous carcinoma of the cervix but notfor adenocarcinoma of the cervix due to its highchemo and radioresistance therefore differentiatingadenocarcinoma from squamous carcinoma is importantin order to provide patients with most suitable therapyp p and cytokeratin ck are the mostcommon panel ofimmunochemical markers for thediagnosis of squamous carcinoma p and ckare traditional markers that indicate squamous differentiation in primary lung neoplasms most squamouscarcinomas and large cell carcinomas are positive forck warth found that the probability of acorrect sqcc diagnosis using ck is p a transcriptional regulator has a crucial role in thedevelopment and differentiation of stratified squamousepithelium it is usually strongly expressed in the basalkeratinocytes \\u00e2 vosmik analyzed patientswith cervical squamous cell carcinoma and found that had positive expression of p p is a new specific marker for distinguishing squamouscarcinomas from adenocarcinoma whose specificity isabout in lung carcinomas however the positiveexpression of ck p and p are only found in a fewadenocarcinomas kriegsmann suggested theuse of either ck or p over

cell adhesion signal transduction immune activation and inhibition at present at least mucins have been found inthe female reproductive system riethdorf and albarracin used immunohistochemistrymethods to detect the expression of mucac in different female reproductive system malignant tumors theyfound that mucac was highly expressed in cervicaladenocarcinoma and poorly expressed inendometrial adenocarcinoma all of themwere expressed in the primary ovarian mucinous tumor but not in colon adenocarcinoma therefore they concluded that mucac could beused as an effective marker to distinguish the origin ofpelvic tumors and distinguish primary ovarian tumorsand colorectal metastasis as well as endometrial adenocarcinoma from cervical metastasis in thisstudy we found positive expression of mucac in cases of cervical adenocarcinoma and in cases of squamous carcinoma which wasconsistent with riethdorf\\u00e2 s study the sensitivity ofmucac and ck to cervical adenocarcinoma was and

of surgery crshipecis time consuming and complex   which presents agreat challenge for the anaesthesiologist in terms of perioperative managementdue to the stable respiratory and circulatory

assessing the severity of cap it wasworthwhile to know that no previous study has beendone at assiut university hospital to assess those twobiomarkers in patients with cap the main potentialmechanism for rising mpv in patient population is severe inflammation caused by pneumonia in severe infection increased release of thrombopoietin and variousinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin1  and and

is required to assess the balance of benefits and risks of performing or not performing specificoncologic interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate

attributes on the axon guidance pathway axon repulsion and axonattraction see the hsa04360 pathway in the KEGG dataset We cannot determinewhich functional attributes contribute more to the disease

other patients [] The recent global pandemic of coronavirus disease COVID19 has encouraged the use of telemedicine for patients with  upper  respiratory  symptoms  []  Because  smartphones  have

transmission  There  have  been  several  approaches  adopting  deep learning  for  automated  diagnosis  of  several  diseases  using  images captured by smartphones [] Pharyngitis which is diagnosed in more than  million patients in the United States annually is a common condition associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection [] Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the back of the throat and tonsils Sore throat caused by pharyngitis is one of the main causes of medical visits for young patients [] The most common cause of acute  pharyngitis is a selflimiting viral infection However Streptococcus pyogenes is the major bacterial infectious cause of pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated \\u00c2\\u0093 of cases of sore throat [] Frequently severe pharyngitis with fever and exudative tonsillitis is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated  and  postinfectious  complications  such  as  acute rheumatic  fever  []  Therefore  timely  diagnosis  of  pharyngitis  for treatment is important to reduce symptoms fever and complications [] However many patients with upper respiratory infection ignore their symptoms in the early stage and medical visits do not routinely take place Moreover in recent days many patients hesitate to visit clinics because of the COVID19 outbreak The importance of a mobilebased monitoring system for patients with acute upper respiratory infections has been raised because of its applicability  and  effectiveness  []  A  previous  study  endeavored  to collect throat images using additional equipment in conjunction with the  smartphone  and  used  the  knearest  neighbor  algorithm  in  color distribution  space  to  classify  images  with  streptococcal  tonsil  [] However the need for additional equipment limited their effectiveness of this method in a realworld setting Moreover color distribution was unable to represent the characteristic features of pharyngitis Throat images exhibit variation in the size illumination and shape of the oral cavity Here  we  present  a  deep  learning  model  with  smartphonebased throat  images  facilitating  the  detection  of  severe  pharyngitis  using selftaken throat images Fig  We performed automated detection of severe  pharyngitis  using  a  convolutional  neural  network  CNN framework  Methods  Data collection The basic concept of our framework is throat examination using a selftaken  smartphone  image  with  computeraided  diagnosis  system which is similar to the previous dermatology study [] This study was performed using publicly accessible selftaken throat images on the web We collected throat images from webbased   social QA systems including  Naver  Korea  kinnavercom  and  Yahoo  Japan chiebukuroyahoocojp The additional throat image datasets were  extracted  using  the  Google  image  search  engine  Most  throat  Data augmentation using GAN Because  of  the  limited  number  of  datasets  and  their  imbalanced distribution data augmentation is required for deep learning training Basic data augmentation techniques such as flip translation rotation and brightness change have been applied to train deep learning models Several previous studies have attempted to train deep learning models using generative adversarial network GANbased synthetic images to increase the classification performance [] Inspired by previous works using  a  generative  adversarial  network  we  adopted the CycleGANbased data augmentation to increase the accuracy of diagnosis The cycle consistency in Fig  allows CycleGAN to capture the characteristics of two image domains and automatically learn how these characteristics should be translated to transfer to domains without any paired datasets [] CycleGAN was developed to overcome the limitations of paired data when two generators and two discriminators are used It is considered to be a powerful technique that performs image domain transfer and face transfer [] Previous studies have demonstrated that CycleGAN can improve deep learning models by generating training situations to learn better decision boundaries between classes We

transformations as the basic augmentation step In this step  normal throat and  pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the training set and  normal throat and  pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the validation set Using the data with basic augmentation we trained the CycleGAN models to transform both normal to pharyngitis throat images and pharyngitis to normal images The trained CycleGAN model augmented the training set  normal throat and  pharyngitis images  before  augmentation  and  a  total  of    throat  images including  normal and  pharyngitis images were prepared to train the diagnostic classifier model after CycleGANbased augmentation  It  should  be  noted  that  supervised  GAN  techniques  including conditional GAN and Pix2px were unable to be applied in this study because of a lack of paired normal and pharyngitis images To use a verified and predesigned image generator all the input images required resizing to a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  which is the basic setup of a CycleGAN Therefore we used the default parameter settings that is the ADAM optimizer with a batch size of  to optimize the GAN networks  Development of CNN model We trained conventional deep learning models after data augmentation Because of a small image dataset in this study developing a custom deep learning method is challenging due to difficulty and time consuming eg a small training dataset can easily result in an over fitted model and low performance [] To overcome the problem of the  small  dataset  transfer  learning  was  widely  used  to  train  deep learning models using pretrained architectures [] This study also applied pretrained learning models to the classification task of throat images The last fully connected layer of the CNNs was only trained and the study used the pretrained conventional model as a feature extractor [] The CNN models including ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and MobileNet v2 were adopted to build binary classifiers [] These CNN models have been used successfully in many studies demonstrating stateoftheart performance with the saliency map [] The models were trained using the training set and the validation set was used to estimate how well the model had been trained We downloaded the CNN models which  were  pretrained  on  the  ImageNet  database  and  performed finetuning  of the weights of  the pretrained networks  This process generally  maintains  the  weights  of  some  bottom  layers  to  avoid overfitting and performs delicate modification of the highlevel features To use the images generated by CycleGAN the size of the input images for the deep learning models was set to a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  and the images were resized for each pretrained model Most conventional deep learning models adopted a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097 \\u00c2\\u0097  or  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  [] One deep learning research showed that the best performance was achieved at an image resolution of between  \\u00c2\\u0097  and  \\u00c2\\u0097  pixels for binary classification [] Therefore the resolution of our study was appropriate to detect pharyngitis in a binary decision The model was trained with  epochs and a batch size of  The ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of  was also used with a crossentropy loss for all CNN models The crossentropy loss function is defined as Lcross entropy  cid0\\u00c2\\u0088\\u00c2\\u0091Nipi logqi  Where pi represents the ground truth value and qi represents predicted probability  value  from  a  classifier  for  the  ith  image  The  optimizer updated the network parameters to minimize the loss function In our experiments it tuned a fully connected layer of the CNN models For example the first  layers of ResNet50 were left frozen and we trained the  last  fully  connected  layer  using  the  training  dataset  which  is described in Table  the ADAM optimizer We chose the final classifier model which maximized the accuracy in the validation dataset To  visualize  the  clusters  to  see  if  the  classes  are  separable  by  a considerable margin the tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding t SNE  algorithm  was  executed  using  sampled  instances  The  feature vectors from the last layer of the pretrained Inceptionv3 model were extracted to train the tSNE [] As there is a growing demand for

development environment using the Tensorflowbased deep learning libraries and a robust graphic processing unit GPU This enables the rapid processing of a heavy deep learning network without the need

\\u00c2\\u0093 GB of free space on the virtual machine hard drive [] We used the Colab CycleGAN tutorial page to develop and validate the CycleGAN model and all of the code is available on the Tensorflow  webpage wwwtensorflowtutorialsgene rativecyclegan We only modified the input pipeline to import our dataset The code of the CycleGAN and CNN models is presented in Supplementary Material  Results We developed a deep learning model using GANbased augmentation in the challenging context of pharyngitis detection To build a balanced training dataset the CycleGAN models generated normal and pathologic throat  images  using  the  initial  training  dataset  The  color  intensity distributions  of  the  pharyngitis  and  normal  throat  images  were  not significantly different although most throat images had exudate regions Fig    A  The  tSNE  algorithm  demonstrates  that  both  groups  are clustered and they are separable by a considerable margin Fig  B The final CycleGAN model for the pharyngitis throat image was trained for  epochs which required  h After training normal throat images were translated into pathologic images and throat images with pharyngitis were translated into normal images Finally we constructed a balanced augmented training dataset including  normal and  pharyngitis  images  using  CycleGAN  The  CycleGANbased  synthetic images were realistic and reflected the characteristic features of pharyngitis  Fig    A  The  CycleGAN  model  synthesized  white  or  gray patches and increased the redness on the throat wall and tonsils from normal images Fig  B Generated throat images were reviewed by three clinicians including an otolaryngologist and an anesthesiologist All pharyngitis images generated were deemed by the three clinicians to show

sample to increase the intra class variation and generalizability The CNN models were trained using the final augmented dataset via the transfer learning technique Fig  demonstrates the training process of the ResNet50 CNN model using the training and validation sets The training process for CNN took approximately  h for  epochs with finetuning for each training step After the 200th epoch the validation accuracy was not improved and the crossentropy of the validation result increased Therefore we considered that training for  epochs was optimal in the ResNet50 model and selected the trained model at the 200th epoch Fig  A shows the training validation and test datasets of CNN  models  with  and  without  CycleGANbased  augmentation  The ROCAUCs of ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and

predicted pharyngitis with the highest  PRCAUC  of    When  a  custom  deep  learning  network without the transfer learning technique was trained the validation accuracy was lower than  and was not improved during the training epochs Supplementary materials Table  shows the performance of CNN models via  4fold cross validation in the entire dataset A similar tendency is observed for the average accuracy and AUC values in the crossvalidation The result shows that the highest detection accuracy and ROCAUC achieved were   and    respectively  by  using  the  ResNet50  Other  CNN models showed lower performance than the ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation but there were no significant differences between CNN models in the 4fold crossvalidation A saliency map using the Grad CAM  technique  was  generated  to  visualize  the  characteristic  pathologic features of pharyngitis for the predicted evidence Fig  A In normal throat images however some regions were highlighted Fig  B  When  synthesized  images  were  tested  using  the  trained  model synthesized exudates were highlighted correctly in the images as shown in Fig  C Furthermore external clinical cases from previous

Example of deep learning classification results with a saliency map using the GradCAM technique A Pharyngitis throat images B Normal throat images C Synthesized images smartphone to obtain throat images We utilized selftaken throat images without additional equipment using deep learning techniques for the detection of pharyngitis We showed that the trained GAN models were able to generate new realistic synthetic throat images which can improve the diagnostic accuracy The final deep learning model achieves high accuracy for automated diagnosis of pharyngitis using smartphone images Therefore this framework could be targeted toward patients with a sore throat who need screening for severe pharyngitis We believe that our study could be extended to computeraided diagnosis using images from an endoscope system in otolaryngology clinics similar to what has been done with colonoscope images using a deep learning model [] To the best of our knowledge no study has been performed to detect pharyngitis based on deep learning using smartphone images However it should be noted that this study is considered as only a preliminary and proofofconcept study because of its technical limitations due to using only Google Colab The current study framework is similar to that of Chamier which showed a deep learning framework using Google Drive and training and prediction on Google Colab [] Our proposed conceptual workflow is shown in Fig  It needs the Flask servers and interfaces implemented using HTML and JavaScript to be applied in a real clinical setting This work could be part of a larger project to enable smartphonebased  pharyngitis  detection  via  a  cloudbased  applevel mobile data analysis We believe that a future appbased model can provide a robust solution for the costeffective and convenient screening of pharyngitis in a telemedicine setting We have highlighted the feasibility of a smartphonebased approach with deep learning to detect pharyngitis Our

showed that the labeling of webbased images is often uncertain [] Therefore further clinical datasets with validation will be required to confirm the effectiveness of our framework Fourth because we collected only throat images via  image search engines there was  no metadata including gender race season or age According to a previous epidemiologic study these factors could affect the pharyngitis detection performance [] Fifth although the datasets were reviewed by authors images could be potentially duplicated in the dataset The duplicated images would affect the independence of the validation dataset We have shown the feasibility of deep learning for the detection of tonsil swelling and exudates in throat images The limitations of our study should be overcome by the availability of a sufficient number of throat images taken by a smartphone with a wellanized study protocol To  validate the  effectiveness of our framework  a prospective study with many patients should be performed in a clinic once the app based framework is developed This will solve the problem of possible duplicated images in the dataset and the absence of metadata  Conclusion TK Yoo                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    additional equipment to collect throat images and we collected self taken images using a smartphone The use of webbased image capture of users from various devices and GANbased image augmentation may  allow  robust  image  processing  While  in  the  current  study  the implementation was performed on a desktop computer and the Colab\\u00c2\\u0099s remote server a smartphone application will also be possible to perform this  identification  for  detecting  pharyngitis  The  light  deep  learning models such as MobileNet can be executed on a smartphone without transmitting the images to a server [] Our result demonstrates that MobileNetv2  also  has  a  high  diagnostic  performance  similar  to ResNet50 and Inceptionv3 In future research an increased amount of training data is needed to improve the detection accuracy using light models The utility of deep learning and smartphones may facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine and physical examination platforms via our approach Furthermore the presented framework enabled using a smartphone camera and deep learning techniques will help the patients  in  selfscreening  for  severe  pharyngitis  and  may  accelerate diagnostic support in remote healthcare services Because of the recent pandemic  of  COVID19  patients  with  respiratory  symptoms  need selfmonitoring to evaluate their pathologic status [] Advances in technology will require clinicians to embrace remote healthcare services The framework presented in this paper was designed for the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment

domains finally we collected the initial dataset with two classes including throat images with pharyngitis and normal throat images the dataset was randomly separated into training n validation n and test sets n to apply deep learning to an independent dataset detailed data distribution and augmentation are described in table only the throat and tonsils images were used for the input data without further manipulation to reduce the intraclass variance original images were extracted from the database in the png portable network graphics format the images were resampled to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 in the png formatfor cyclegan and deep learning models all procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and the helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards this study did not require ethics committee approval instead the researchers used webbased and deidentified data all datasets for the development of the deep learning model are available at mendeley data repositories ynyhnjkz tk yoo transmission there have been several approaches adopting deep learning for automated diagnosis of several diseases using images captured by smartphones pharyngitis which is diagnosed in more than million patients in the united states annually is a common condition associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection pharyngitis is an inflammation of the back of the throat and tonsils sore throat caused by pharyngitis is one of the main causes of medical visits for young patients the most common cause of acute pharyngitis is a selflimiting viral infection however streptococcus pyogenes is the major bacterial infectious cause of pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated \\u00e2 of cases of sore throat frequently severe pharyngitis with fever and exudative tonsillitis is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated and postinfectious complications such as acute rheumatic fever therefore timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment is important to reduce symptoms fever and complications however many patients with upper respiratory infection ignore their symptoms in the early stage and medical visits do not routinely take place moreover in recent days many patients hesitate to visit clinics because of the covid outbreak the importance of a mobilebased monitoring system for patients with acute upper respiratory infections has been raised because of its applicability and effectiveness a previous study endeavored to collect throat images using additional equipment in conjunction with the smartphone and used the knearest neighbor algorithm in color distribution space to classify images with streptococcal tonsil however the need for additional equipment limited their effectiveness of this method in a realworld setting moreover color distribution was unable to represent the characteristic features of pharyngitis throat images exhibit variation in the size illumination and shape of the oral cavity here we present a deep learning model with smartphonebased throat images facilitating the detection of severe pharyngitis using selftaken throat images fig we performed automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a convolutional neural network cnn framework methods data collection the basic concept of our framework is throat examination using a selftaken smartphone image with computeraided diagnosis system which is similar to the previous dermatology study this study was performed using publicly accessible selftaken throat images on the web we collected throat images from webbased social qa systems including naver korea kinnavercom and yahoo japan chiebukuroyahoocojp the additional throat image datasets were extracted using the google image search engine most throat data augmentation using gan because of the limited number of datasets and their imbalanced distribution data augmentation is required for deep learning training basic data augmentation techniques such as flip translation rotation and brightness change have been applied to train deep learning models several previous studies have attempted to train deep learning models using generative adversarial network ganbased synthetic images to increase the classification performance inspired by previous works using a generative adversarial network we adopted the cycleganbased data augmentation to increase the accuracy of diagnosis the cycle consistency in fig allows cyclegan to capture the characteristics of two image domains and automatically learn how these characteristics should be translated to transfer to domains without any paired datasets cyclegan was developed to overcome the limitations of paired data when two generators and two discriminators are used it is considered to be a powerful technique that performs image domain transfer and face transfer previous studies have demonstrated that cyclegan can improve deep learning models by generating training situations to learn better decision boundaries between classes we built the cyclegan augmentation model to increase the fig workflow of building a deep learning model for pharyngitis diagnosis using a smartphone computersinbiologyandmedicine ctk yoo fig schematics of the cyclegan model generating new normal images and pathologic throat images with pharyngitis generalizability of the dataset and to improve the classification performance in the imbalanced dataset before training the cyclegan the throat images were augmented using linear transformation including left and right flip width and height translation from to random rotation from \\u00e2 \\u00e2 to \\u00e2 \\u00e2 zooming from to and random brightness change from to we defined these transformations as the basic augmentation step in this step normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the training set and normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the validation set using the data with basic augmentation we trained the cyclegan models to transform both normal to pharyngitis throat images and pharyngitis to normal images the trained cyclegan model augmented the training set normal throat and pharyngitis images before augmentation and a total of throat images including normal and pharyngitis images were prepared to train the diagnostic classifier model after cycleganbased augmentation it should be noted that supervised gan techniques including conditional gan and pixpx were unable to be applied in this study because of a lack of paired normal and pharyngitis images to use a verified and predesigned image generator all the input images required resizing to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 which is the basic setup of a cyclegan therefore we used the default parameter settings that is the adam optimizer with a batch size of to optimize the gan networks development of cnn model we trained conventional deep learning models after data augmentation because of a small image dataset in this study developing a custom deep learning method is challenging due to difficulty and time consuming eg a small training dataset can easily result in an over fitted model and low performance to overcome the problem of the small dataset transfer learning was widely used to train deep learning models using pretrained architectures this study also applied pretrained learning models to the classification task of throat images the last fully connected layer of the cnns was only trained and the study used the pretrained conventional model as a feature extractor the cnn models including resnet inceptionv and mobilenet v were adopted to build binary classifiers these cnn models have been used successfully in many studies demonstrating stateoftheart performance with the saliency map the models were trained using the training set and the validation set was used to estimate how well the model had been trained we downloaded the cnn models which were pretrained on the imagenet database and performed finetuning of the weights of the pretrained networks this process generally maintains the weights of some bottom layers to avoid overfitting and performs delicate modification of the highlevel features to use the images generated by cyclegan the size of the input images for the deep learning models was set to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 and the images were resized for each pretrained model most conventional deep learning models adopted a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 or \\u00e2 \\u00e2 one deep learning research showed that the best performance was achieved at an image resolution of between \\u00e2 and \\u00e2 pixels for binary classification therefore the resolution of our study was appropriate to detect pharyngitis in a binary decision the model was trained with epochs and a batch size of the adam optimizer with a learning rate of was also used with a crossentropy loss for all cnn models the crossentropy loss function is defined as lcross entropy cid\\u00e2 \\u00e2 nipi logqi where pi represents the ground truth value and qi represents predicted probability value from a classifier for the ith image the optimizer updated the network parameters to minimize the loss function in our experiments it tuned a fully connected layer of the cnn models for example the first layers of resnet were left frozen and we trained the last fully connected layer using the training dataset which is described in table the adam optimizer we chose the final classifier model which maximized the accuracy in the validation dataset to visualize the clusters to see if the classes are separable by a considerable margin the tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne algorithm was executed using sampled instances the feature vectors from the last layer of the pretrained inceptionv model were extracted to train the tsne as there is a growing demand for explainable artificial intelligence methods in medicine we adopted githubcomjacobgilpytorch the gradcam technique computersinbiologyandmedicine ctk yoo table throat image dataset and augmentation used in this study number of validation set number of training set raw data basic augmentation ganbased image synthesis augmentation class normal pharyngitis normal pharyngitis normal pharyngitis number of test set gan generative adversarial network gradcam to generate the attention map the gradcam visualizes the decisional areas of the cnn model using the gradients of any target flowing into the final convolutional network the heatmap has a low resolution and it was upsampled via bicubic interpolation finally it produces heatmaps that highlight the area of interest and interprets the decision of the deep learning models the performance of the cnn models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc and the precisionrecall curve prc the youden index which is an estimate of the optimal diagnostic threshold was adopted in this study after obtaining the sensitivity and specificity the youden index was calculated at each cutoff point we selected the optimal value which maximized the youden index these performance indexes are expressed as follows accuracy tp tntp tn fp fn sensitivity recall tptp fnspecificity precision tntn fptptp fp youden index sensitivity specificity cid where tp tn fp and fn denote true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives respectively we also performed a fold crossvalidation using the entire dataset to evaluate a generalized performance google colab pro a cloud service for disseminating the deep learning research was adopted to implement the cyclegan and cnn models google colab pro provides a development environment using the tensorflowbased deep learning libraries and a robust graphic processing unit gpu this enables the rapid processing of a heavy deep learning network without the need for a personal gpu the available hardware for each virtual machine varied by session but typically included top products of nvidia gpus k t or p around \\u00e2 gb of ram and \\u00e2 gb of free space on the virtual machine hard drive we used the colab cyclegan tutorial page to develop and validate the cyclegan model and all of the code is available on the tensorflow webpage wwwtensorflowtutorialsgene rativecyclegan we only modified the input pipeline to import our dataset the code of the cyclegan and cnn models is presented in supplementary material results we developed a deep learning model using ganbased augmentation in the challenging context of pharyngitis detection to build a balanced training dataset the cyclegan models generated normal and pathologic throat images using the initial training dataset the color intensity distributions of the pharyngitis and normal throat images were not significantly different although most throat images had exudate regions fig a the tsne algorithm demonstrates that both groups are clustered and they are separable by a considerable margin fig b the final cyclegan model for the pharyngitis throat image was trained for epochs which required h after training normal throat images were translated into pathologic images and throat images with pharyngitis were translated into normal images finally we constructed a balanced augmented training dataset including normal and pharyngitis images using cyclegan the cycleganbased synthetic images were realistic and reflected the characteristic features of pharyngitis fig a the cyclegan model synthesized white or gray patches and increased the redness on the throat wall and tonsils from normal images fig b generated throat images were reviewed by three clinicians including an otolaryngologist and an anesthesiologist all pharyngitis images generated were deemed by the three clinicians to show \\u00e2 more pathologic and inflammatory\\u00e2 results when compared to the original images this feature generation based on the cyclegan model can be effective for generating a new sample to increase the intra class variation and generalizability the cnn models were trained using the final augmented dataset via the transfer learning technique fig demonstrates the training process of the resnet cnn model using the training and validation sets the training process for cnn took approximately h for epochs with finetuning for each training step after the th epoch the validation accuracy was not improved and the crossentropy of the validation result increased therefore we considered that training for epochs was optimal in the resnet model and selected the trained model at the th epoch fig a shows the training validation and test datasets of cnn models with and without cycleganbased augmentation the rocaucs of resnet inceptionv and mobilenetv without gan based augmentation were and respectively fig b we obtained the best rocauc of pharyngitis detection using resnet with ganbased augmentation corresponding to fig c at the optimal diagnostic cutoff value the resnet model predicted pharyngitis with an accuracy of sensitivity of and specificity of the rocauc of inceptionv and mobilenetv corresponded to and respectively the models with gan based augmentation demonstrated superior performance in comparison with the models with only basic augmentation we also evaluated the performance of the models using prcs fig the prcauc also demonstrated that deep learning models with ganbased augmentation had better performance than those without ganbased augmentation resnet with ganbased augmentation predicted pharyngitis with the highest prcauc of when a custom deep learning network without the transfer learning technique was trained the validation accuracy was lower than and was not improved during the training epochs supplementary materials table shows the performance of cnn models via fold cross validation in the entire dataset a similar tendency is observed for the average accuracy and auc values in the crossvalidation the result shows that the highest detection accuracy and rocauc achieved were and respectively by using the resnet other cnn models showed lower performance than the resnet with ganbased augmentation but there were no significant differences between cnn models in the fold crossvalidation a saliency map using the grad cam technique was generated to visualize the characteristic pathologic features of pharyngitis for the predicted evidence fig a in normal throat images however some regions were highlighted fig b when synthesized images were tested using the trained model synthesized exudates were highlighted correctly in the images as

synthesized images smartphone to obtain throat images we utilized selftaken throat images without additional equipment using deep learning techniques for the detection of pharyngitis we showed that the trained gan models were able to generate new realistic synthetic throat images which can improve the diagnostic accuracy the final deep learning model achieves high accuracy for automated diagnosis of pharyngitis using smartphone images therefore this framework could be targeted toward patients with a sore throat who need screening for severe pharyngitis we believe that our study could be extended to computeraided diagnosis using images from an endoscope system in otolaryngology clinics similar to what has been done with colonoscope images using a deep learning model to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed to detect pharyngitis based on deep learning using smartphone images however it should be noted that this study is considered as only a preliminary and proofofconcept study because of its technical limitations due to using only google colab the current study framework is similar to that of chamier which showed a deep learning framework using google drive and training and prediction on google colab our proposed conceptual workflow is shown in fig it needs the flask servers and interfaces implemented using html and javascript to be applied in a real clinical setting this work could be part of a larger project to enable smartphonebased pharyngitis detection via a cloudbased applevel mobile data analysis we believe that a future appbased model can provide a robust solution for the costeffective and convenient screening of pharyngitis in a telemedicine setting we have highlighted the feasibility of a smartphonebased approach with deep learning to detect pharyngitis our approach does not require fig classification results from the deep learning model applied to clinical cases with severe pharyngitis a an yearold man with odynophagia b a yearold diabetic man with throat pain fig example of a proposed smartphonebased system for pharyngitis detection computersinbiologyandmedicine cexplored clinical datasets and webbased datasets and showed that the labeling of webbased images is often uncertain therefore further clinical datasets with validation will be required to confirm the effectiveness of our framework fourth because we collected only throat images via image search engines there was no metadata including gender race season or age according to a previous epidemiologic study these factors could affect the pharyngitis detection performance fifth although the datasets were reviewed by authors images could be potentially duplicated in the dataset the duplicated images would affect the independence of the validation dataset we have shown the feasibility of deep learning for the detection of tonsil swelling and exudates in throat images the limitations of our study should be overcome by the availability of a sufficient number of throat images taken by a smartphone with a wellanized study protocol to validate the effectiveness of our framework a prospective study with many patients should be performed in a clinic once the app based framework is developed this will solve the problem of possible duplicated images in the dataset and the absence of metadata conclusion tk yoo additional equipment to collect throat images and we collected self taken images using a smartphone the use of webbased image capture of users from various devices and ganbased image augmentation may allow robust image processing while in the current study the implementation was performed on a desktop computer and the colab\\u00e2 s remote server a smartphone application will also be possible to perform this identification for detecting pharyngitis the light deep learning models such as mobilenet can be executed on a smartphone without transmitting the images to a server our result demonstrates that mobilenetv also has a high diagnostic performance similar to resnet and inceptionv in future research an increased amount of training data is needed to improve the detection accuracy using light models the utility of deep learning and smartphones may facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine and physical examination platforms via our approach furthermore the presented framework enabled using a smartphone camera and deep learning techniques will help the patients in selfscreening for severe pharyngitis and may accelerate diagnostic support in remote healthcare services because of the recent pandemic of covid patients with respiratory symptoms need selfmonitoring to evaluate their pathologic status advances in technology will require clinicians to embrace remote healthcare services the framework presented in this paper was designed for the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment similar smartphoneimagebased diagnostic approaches have been introduced in several other medical image

of surgery crshipecis time consuming and complex   which presents agreat challenge for the anaesthesiologist in terms of perioperative managementdue to the stable respiratory and circulatory supportgeneral anaesthesia is the preferred choice in this surgery however long periods of general anaesthesia leadto drug accumulation in the body followed by increasedanaesthesiarelated

assessing the severity of cap it wasworthwhile to know that no previous study has beendone at assiut university hospital to assess those twobiomarkers in patients with cap the main potentialmechanism for rising mpv in patient population is severe inflammation caused by pneumonia in severe infection increased release of thrombopoietin and variousinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin1  and and

is required to assess the balance of benefits and risks of performing or not performing specificoncologic interventions taking cancerspecific mortalityinto consideration Clinicians may need to know if thepatient will die of cancer or with cancer in cases wherecomorbidities or geriatric syndromes are challengingSeveral scales have been created and validated in largeepidemiologic cohorts to estimate

associated with the process of oxidative stressand inflammation which reflects the prognostic role ofrdw to our knowledge rdw use does not implyany additional cost because it is routinely provided

pathway SebastianLeon   Diseasesare always related to the abnormal signal that the effector genes receive Thereforethe signal that the effector genes receive can be very different under disease andnormal conditions The limitation of the previously mentioned methods includinggeneweightbased methods is that they do not consider the signal variations betweendisease and normal conditionsAdditionally the functional attributes in the same signaling pathway may be verydifferent from one another and can sometimes be opposites For example there are twoopposite functional attributes on the axon guidance pathway axon repulsion and axonattraction see the hsa04360 pathway in the KEGG dataset We cannot determinewhich functional attributes contribute more to the disease using most current pathwayanalysis methods Furthermore some pathways consist of several parts each with verydifferent contributions For example the Wnt signaling pathway is significant acrossdifferent

transmission  There  have  been  several  approaches  adopting  deep learning  for  automated  diagnosis  of  several  diseases  using  images captured by smartphones [] Pharyngitis which is diagnosed in more than  million patients in the United States annually is a common condition associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection [] Pharyngitis is an inflammation of the back of the throat and tonsils Sore throat caused by pharyngitis is one of the main causes of medical visits for young patients [] The most common cause of acute  pharyngitis is a selflimiting viral infection However Streptococcus pyogenes is the major bacterial infectious cause of pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated \\u00c2\\u0093 of cases of sore throat [] Frequently severe pharyngitis with fever and exudative tonsillitis is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated  and  postinfectious  complications  such  as  acute rheumatic  fever  []  Therefore  timely  diagnosis  of  pharyngitis  for treatment is important to reduce symptoms fever and complications [] However many patients with upper respiratory infection ignore their symptoms in the early stage and medical visits do not routinely take place Moreover in recent days many patients hesitate to visit clinics because of the COVID19 outbreak The importance of a mobilebased monitoring system for patients with acute upper respiratory infections has been raised because of its applicability  and  effectiveness  []  A  previous  study  endeavored  to collect throat images using additional equipment in conjunction with the  smartphone  and  used  the  knearest  neighbor  algorithm  in  color distribution  space  to  classify  images  with  streptococcal  tonsil  [] However the need for additional equipment limited their effectiveness of this method in a realworld setting Moreover color distribution was unable to represent the characteristic features of pharyngitis Throat images exhibit variation in the size illumination and shape of the oral cavity Here  we  present  a  deep  learning  model  with  smartphonebased throat  images  facilitating  the  detection  of  severe  pharyngitis  using selftaken throat images Fig  We performed automated detection of severe  pharyngitis  using  a  convolutional  neural  network  CNN framework  Methods  Data collection The basic concept of our framework is throat examination using a selftaken  smartphone  image  with  computeraided  diagnosis  system which is similar to the previous dermatology study [] This study was performed using publicly accessible selftaken throat images on the web We collected throat images from webbased   social QA systems including  Naver  Korea  kinnavercom  and  Yahoo  Japan chiebukuroyahoocojp The additional throat image datasets were  extracted  using  the  Google  image  search  engine  Most  throat  Data augmentation using GAN Because  of  the  limited  number  of  datasets  and  their  imbalanced distribution data augmentation is required for deep learning training Basic data augmentation techniques such as flip translation rotation and brightness change have been applied to train deep learning models Several previous studies have attempted to train deep learning models using generative adversarial network GANbased synthetic images to increase the classification performance [] Inspired by previous works using  a  generative  adversarial  network  we  adopted the CycleGANbased data augmentation to increase the accuracy of diagnosis The cycle consistency in Fig  allows CycleGAN to capture the characteristics of two image domains and automatically learn how these characteristics should be translated to transfer to domains without any paired datasets [] CycleGAN was developed to overcome the limitations of paired data when two generators and two discriminators are used It is considered to be a powerful technique that performs image domain transfer and face transfer [] Previous studies have demonstrated that CycleGAN can improve deep learning models by generating training situations to learn better decision boundaries between classes We

transformations as the basic augmentation step In this step  normal throat and  pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the training set and  normal throat and  pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the validation set Using the data with basic augmentation we trained the CycleGAN models to transform both normal to pharyngitis throat images and pharyngitis to normal images The trained CycleGAN model augmented the training set  normal throat and  pharyngitis images  before  augmentation  and  a  total  of    throat  images including  normal and  pharyngitis images were prepared to train the diagnostic classifier model after CycleGANbased augmentation  It  should  be  noted  that  supervised  GAN  techniques  including conditional GAN and Pix2px were unable to be applied in this study because of a lack of paired normal and pharyngitis images To use a verified and predesigned image generator all the input images required resizing to a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  which is the basic setup of a CycleGAN Therefore we used the default parameter settings that is the ADAM optimizer with a batch size of  to optimize the GAN networks  Development of CNN model We trained conventional deep learning models after data augmentation Because of a small image dataset in this study developing a custom deep learning method is challenging due to difficulty and time consuming eg a small training dataset can easily result in an over fitted model and low performance [] To overcome the problem of the  small  dataset  transfer  learning  was  widely  used  to  train  deep learning models using pretrained architectures [] This study also applied pretrained learning models to the classification task of throat images The last fully connected layer of the CNNs was only trained and the study used the pretrained conventional model as a feature extractor [] The CNN models including ResNet50 Inceptionv3 and MobileNet v2 were adopted to build binary classifiers [] These CNN models have been used successfully in many studies demonstrating stateoftheart performance with the saliency map [] The models were trained using the training set and the validation set was used to estimate how well the model had been trained We downloaded the CNN models which  were  pretrained  on  the  ImageNet  database  and  performed finetuning  of the weights of  the pretrained networks  This process generally  maintains  the  weights  of  some  bottom  layers  to  avoid overfitting and performs delicate modification of the highlevel features To use the images generated by CycleGAN the size of the input images for the deep learning models was set to a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  and the images were resized for each pretrained model Most conventional deep learning models adopted a pixel resolution of  \\u00c2\\u0097 \\u00c2\\u0097  or  \\u00c2\\u0097  \\u00c2\\u0097  [] One deep learning research showed that the best performance was achieved at an image resolution of between  \\u00c2\\u0097  and  \\u00c2\\u0097  pixels for binary classification [] Therefore the resolution of our study was appropriate to detect pharyngitis in a binary decision The model was trained with  epochs and a batch size of  The ADAM optimizer with a learning rate of  was also used with a crossentropy loss for all CNN models The crossentropy loss function is defined as Lcross entropy  cid0\\u00c2\\u0088\\u00c2\\u0091Nipi logqi  Where pi represents the ground truth value and qi represents predicted probability  value  from  a  classifier  for  the  ith  image  The  optimizer updated the network parameters to minimize the loss function In our experiments it tuned a fully connected layer of the CNN models For example the first  layers of ResNet50 were left frozen and we trained the  last  fully  connected  layer  using  the  training  dataset  which  is described in Table  the ADAM optimizer We chose the final classifier model which maximized the accuracy in the validation dataset To  visualize  the  clusters  to  see  if  the  classes  are  separable  by  a considerable margin the tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding t SNE  algorithm  was  executed  using  sampled  instances  The  feature vectors from the last layer of the pretrained Inceptionv3 model were extracted to train the tSNE [] As there is a growing demand for

development environment using the Tensorflowbased deep learning libraries and a robust graphic processing unit GPU This enables the rapid processing of a heavy deep learning network without the need

\\u00c2\\u0093 GB of free space on the virtual machine hard drive [] We used the Colab CycleGAN tutorial page to develop and validate the CycleGAN model and all of the code is available on the Tensorflow  webpage wwwtensorflowtutorialsgene rativecyclegan We only modified the input pipeline to import our dataset The code of the CycleGAN and CNN models is presented in Supplementary Material  Results We developed a deep learning model using GANbased augmentation in the challenging context of pharyngitis detection To build a balanced training dataset the CycleGAN models generated normal and pathologic throat  images  using  the  initial  training  dataset  The  color  intensity distributions  of  the  pharyngitis  and  normal  throat  images  were  not significantly different although most throat images had exudate regions Fig    A  The  tSNE  algorithm  demonstrates  that  both  groups  are clustered and they are separable by a considerable margin Fig  B The final CycleGAN model for the pharyngitis throat image was trained for  epochs which required  h After training normal throat images were translated into pathologic images and throat images with pharyngitis were translated into normal images Finally we constructed a balanced augmented training dataset including  normal and  pharyngitis  images  using  CycleGAN  The  CycleGANbased  synthetic images were realistic and reflected the characteristic features of pharyngitis  Fig    A  The  CycleGAN  model  synthesized  white  or  gray patches and increased the redness on the throat wall and tonsils from normal images Fig  B Generated throat images were reviewed by three clinicians including an otolaryngologist and an anesthesiologist All pharyngitis images generated were deemed by the three clinicians to show \\u00c2\\u009cmore pathologic and inflammatory\\u00c2\\u009d results when compared to the original images This feature generation based on the CycleGAN model can be effective for generating a new sample to increase the intra class variation and generalizability The CNN models were trained using the final augmented dataset via the transfer learning technique Fig  demonstrates the training process of the ResNet50 CNN model using the training and validation sets The training process for CNN took approximately  h for  epochs with finetuning for each training step After the 200th epoch the validation accuracy was not improved and the crossentropy of the validation result increased Therefore we considered that training for  epochs was optimal in the ResNet50 model and selected the

predicted pharyngitis with the highest  PRCAUC  of    When  a  custom  deep  learning  network without the transfer learning technique was trained the validation accuracy was lower than  and was not improved during the training epochs Supplementary materials Table  shows the performance of CNN models via  4fold cross validation in the entire dataset A similar tendency is observed for the average accuracy and AUC values in the crossvalidation The result shows that the highest detection accuracy and ROCAUC achieved were   and    respectively  by  using  the  ResNet50  Other  CNN models showed lower performance than the ResNet50 with GANbased augmentation but there were no significant differences between CNN models in the 4fold crossvalidation A saliency map using the Grad CAM  technique  was  generated  to  visualize  the  characteristic  pathologic features of pharyngitis for the predicted evidence Fig  A In normal throat images however some regions were highlighted Fig  B  When  synthesized  images  were  tested  using  the  trained  model synthesized exudates were highlighted correctly in the images as shown in Fig  C Furthermore external clinical cases from previous

in  both  cases  The  GradCAM technique highlighted white patches on the throat wall as markers of severe pharyngitis in the deep learning model  Discussion The current proofofconcept study investigated the possibility of deep  learning  using  a  smartphone  for  detecting  pharyngitis  A recentstudy  demonstrated  the  ability  of  selftaken  throat  images  to detect pharyngitis based on the knearest neighbor algorithm in a color space  []  That  study  used  additional  equipment  as  well  as  a ComputersinBiologyandMedicine12520201039806 0cTK Yoo

Example of deep learning classification results with a saliency map using the GradCAM technique A Pharyngitis throat images B Normal throat images C Synthesized images smartphone to obtain throat images We utilized selftaken throat images without additional equipment using deep learning techniques for the detection of pharyngitis We showed that the trained GAN models were able to generate new realistic synthetic throat images which can improve the diagnostic accuracy The final deep learning model achieves high accuracy for automated diagnosis of pharyngitis using smartphone images Therefore this framework could be targeted toward patients with a sore throat who need screening for severe pharyngitis We believe that our study could be extended to computeraided diagnosis using images from an endoscope system in otolaryngology clinics similar to what has been done with colonoscope images using a deep learning model [] To the best of our knowledge no study has been performed to detect pharyngitis based on deep learning using smartphone images However it should be noted that this study is considered as only a preliminary and proofofconcept study because of its technical limitations due to using only Google Colab The current study framework is similar to that of Chamier which showed a deep learning framework using Google Drive and training and prediction on Google Colab [] Our proposed conceptual workflow is shown in Fig  It needs the Flask servers and interfaces implemented using HTML and JavaScript to be applied in a real clinical setting This work could be part of a larger project to enable smartphonebased  pharyngitis  detection  via  a  cloudbased  applevel mobile data analysis We believe that a future appbased model can provide a robust solution for the costeffective and convenient screening of pharyngitis in a telemedicine setting We have highlighted the feasibility of a smartphonebased approach with deep learning to detect pharyngitis Our approach does not require Fig  Classification results from the deep learning model applied to clinical cases with severe pharyngitis A An 81yearold man with odynophagia [] B A 41yearold diabetic man

showed that the labeling of webbased images is often uncertain [] Therefore further clinical datasets with validation will be required to confirm the effectiveness of our framework Fourth because we collected only throat images via  image search engines there was  no metadata including gender race season or age According to a previous epidemiologic study these factors could affect the pharyngitis detection performance [] Fifth although the datasets were reviewed by authors images could be potentially duplicated in the dataset The duplicated images would affect the independence of the validation dataset We have shown the feasibility of deep learning for the detection of tonsil swelling and exudates in throat images The limitations of our study should be overcome by the availability of a sufficient number of throat images taken by a smartphone with a wellanized study protocol To  validate the  effectiveness of our framework  a prospective study with many patients should be performed in a clinic once the app based framework is developed This will solve the problem of possible duplicated images in the dataset and the absence of metadata  Conclusion TK Yoo

application will also be possible to perform this  identification  for  detecting  pharyngitis  The  light  deep  learning models such as MobileNet can be executed on a smartphone without transmitting the images to a server [] Our result demonstrates that MobileNetv2  also  has  a  high  diagnostic  performance  similar  to ResNet50 and Inceptionv3 In future research an increased amount of training data is needed to improve the detection accuracy using light models The utility of deep learning and smartphones may facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine and physical examination platforms via our approach Furthermore the presented framework enabled using a smartphone camera and deep learning techniques will help the patients  in  selfscreening  for  severe  pharyngitis  and  may  accelerate diagnostic support in remote healthcare services Because of the recent pandemic  of  COVID19  patients  with  respiratory  symptoms  need selfmonitoring to evaluate their pathologic status [] Advances in technology will require clinicians to embrace remote healthcare services The framework presented in this paper was designed for the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment

domains finally we collected the initial dataset with two classes including throat images with pharyngitis and normal throat images the dataset was randomly separated into training n validation n and test sets n to apply deep learning to an independent dataset detailed data distribution and augmentation are described in table only the throat and tonsils images were used for the input data without further manipulation to reduce the intraclass variance original images were extracted from the database in the png portable network graphics format the images were resampled to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 in the png formatfor cyclegan and deep learning models all procedures were performed in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and national research committee and

datasets for the development of the deep learning model are available at mendeley data repositories ynyhnjkz tk yoo transmission there have been several approaches adopting deep learning for automated diagnosis of several diseases using images captured by smartphones pharyngitis which is diagnosed in more than million patients in the united states annually is a common condition associated with acute upper respiratory tract infection pharyngitis is an inflammation of the back of the throat and tonsils sore throat caused by pharyngitis is one of the main causes of medical visits for young patients the most common cause of acute pharyngitis is a selflimiting viral infection however streptococcus pyogenes is the major bacterial infectious cause of pharyngitis and is responsible for an estimated \\u00e2 of cases of sore throat frequently severe pharyngitis with fever and exudative tonsillitis is associated with streptococcal pharyngitis which can cause immunemediated and postinfectious complications such as acute rheumatic fever therefore timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment is important to reduce symptoms fever and complications however many patients with upper respiratory infection ignore their symptoms in the early stage and medical visits do not routinely take place moreover in recent days many patients hesitate to visit clinics because of the covid outbreak the importance of a mobilebased monitoring system for patients with acute upper respiratory infections has been raised because of its applicability and effectiveness a previous study endeavored to collect throat images using additional equipment in conjunction with the smartphone and used the knearest neighbor algorithm in color distribution space to classify images with streptococcal tonsil however the need for additional equipment limited their effectiveness of this method in a realworld setting moreover color distribution was unable to represent the characteristic features of pharyngitis throat images exhibit variation in the size illumination and shape of the oral cavity here we present a deep learning model with smartphonebased throat images facilitating the detection of severe pharyngitis using selftaken throat images fig we performed automated detection of severe pharyngitis using a convolutional neural network cnn framework methods data collection the basic concept of our framework is throat examination using a selftaken smartphone image with computeraided diagnosis system which is similar to the previous dermatology study this study was performed using publicly accessible selftaken throat images on the web we collected throat images from webbased social qa systems including naver korea kinnavercom and yahoo japan chiebukuroyahoocojp the additional throat image datasets were extracted using the google image search engine most throat data augmentation using gan because of the limited number of datasets and their imbalanced distribution data augmentation is required for deep learning training basic data augmentation techniques such as flip translation rotation and brightness change have been applied to train deep learning models several previous studies have attempted to train deep learning models using generative adversarial network ganbased synthetic images to increase the classification performance inspired by previous works using a generative adversarial network we adopted the cycleganbased data augmentation to increase the accuracy of diagnosis the cycle consistency in fig allows cyclegan to capture the characteristics of two image domains and automatically learn how these characteristics should be translated to transfer to domains without any paired datasets cyclegan was developed to overcome the limitations of paired data when two generators and two discriminators are used it is considered to be a powerful technique that performs image domain transfer and face transfer previous studies have demonstrated that cyclegan can improve deep learning models by generating training situations to learn better decision boundaries between classes we built the cyclegan augmentation model to increase the fig workflow of building a deep learning model for pharyngitis diagnosis using a smartphone computersinbiologyandmedicine ctk yoo fig schematics of the cyclegan model generating new normal images and pathologic throat images with pharyngitis generalizability of the dataset and to improve the classification performance in the imbalanced dataset before training the cyclegan the throat images were augmented using linear transformation including left and right flip width and height translation from to random rotation from \\u00e2 \\u00e2 to \\u00e2 \\u00e2 zooming from to and random brightness change from to we defined these transformations as the basic augmentation step in this step normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the training set and normal throat and pharyngitis images were randomly sampled for the validation set using the data with basic augmentation we trained the cyclegan models to transform both normal to pharyngitis throat images and pharyngitis to normal images the trained cyclegan model augmented the training set normal throat and pharyngitis images before augmentation and a total of throat images including normal and pharyngitis images were prepared to train the diagnostic classifier model after cycleganbased augmentation it should be noted that supervised gan techniques including conditional gan and pixpx were unable to be applied in this study because of a lack of paired normal and pharyngitis images to use a verified and predesigned image generator all the input images required resizing to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 which is the basic setup of a cyclegan therefore we used the default parameter settings that is the adam optimizer with a batch size of to optimize the gan networks development of cnn model we trained conventional deep learning models after data augmentation because of a small image dataset in this study developing a custom deep learning method is challenging due to difficulty and time consuming eg a small training dataset can easily result in an over fitted model and low performance to overcome the problem of the small dataset transfer learning was widely used to train deep learning models using pretrained architectures this study also applied pretrained learning models to the classification task of throat images the last fully connected layer of the cnns was only trained and the study used the pretrained conventional model as a feature extractor the cnn models including resnet inceptionv and mobilenet v were adopted to build binary classifiers these cnn models have been used successfully in many studies demonstrating stateoftheart performance with the saliency map the models were trained using the training set and the validation set was used to estimate how well the model had been trained we downloaded the cnn models which were pretrained on the imagenet database and performed finetuning of the weights of the pretrained networks this process generally maintains the weights of some bottom layers to avoid overfitting and performs delicate modification of the highlevel features to use the images generated by cyclegan the size of the input images for the deep learning models was set to a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 and the images were resized for each pretrained model most conventional deep learning models adopted a pixel resolution of \\u00e2 \\u00e2 or \\u00e2 \\u00e2 one deep learning research showed that the best performance was achieved at an image resolution of between \\u00e2 and \\u00e2 pixels for binary classification therefore the resolution of our study was appropriate to detect pharyngitis in a binary decision the model was trained with epochs and a batch size of the adam optimizer with a learning rate of was also used with a crossentropy loss for all cnn models the crossentropy loss function is defined as lcross entropy cid\\u00e2 \\u00e2 nipi logqi where pi represents the ground truth value and qi represents predicted probability value from a classifier for the ith image the optimizer updated the network parameters to minimize the loss function in our experiments it tuned a fully connected layer of the cnn models for example the first layers of resnet were left frozen and we trained the last fully connected layer using the training dataset which is described in table the adam optimizer we chose the final classifier model which maximized the accuracy in the validation dataset to visualize the clusters to see if the classes are separable by a considerable margin the tdistributed stochastic neighbor embedding t sne algorithm was executed using sampled instances the feature vectors from the last layer of the pretrained inceptionv model were extracted to train the tsne as there is a growing demand for explainable artificial intelligence methods in medicine we adopted githubcomjacobgilpytorch the gradcam technique computersinbiologyandmedicine ctk yoo table throat image dataset and augmentation used in this study number of validation set number of training set raw data basic augmentation ganbased image synthesis augmentation class normal pharyngitis normal pharyngitis normal pharyngitis number of test set gan generative adversarial network gradcam to generate the attention map the gradcam visualizes the decisional areas of the cnn model using the gradients of any target flowing into the final convolutional network the heatmap has a low resolution and it was upsampled via bicubic interpolation finally it produces heatmaps that highlight the area of interest and interprets the decision of the deep learning models the performance of the cnn models was evaluated based on the accuracy and area under the curve auc of the receiver operating characteristic curve roc and the precisionrecall curve prc the youden index which is an estimate of the optimal diagnostic threshold was adopted in this study after obtaining the sensitivity and specificity the youden index was calculated at each cutoff point we selected the optimal value which maximized the youden index these performance indexes are expressed as follows accuracy tp tntp tn fp fn sensitivity recall tptp fnspecificity precision tntn fptptp fp youden index sensitivity specificity cid where tp tn fp and fn denote true positives true negatives false positives and false negatives respectively we also performed a fold crossvalidation using the entire dataset to evaluate a generalized performance google colab pro a cloud service for disseminating the deep learning research was adopted to implement the cyclegan and cnn models google colab pro provides a development environment using the tensorflowbased deep learning libraries and a robust graphic processing unit gpu this enables the rapid processing of a heavy deep learning network without the need for a personal gpu the available hardware for each virtual machine varied by session but typically included top products of nvidia gpus k t or p around \\u00e2 gb of ram and \\u00e2 gb of free space on the virtual machine hard drive we used the colab cyclegan tutorial page to develop and validate the cyclegan model and all of the code is available on the tensorflow webpage wwwtensorflowtutorialsgene rativecyclegan we only modified the input pipeline to import our dataset the code of the cyclegan and cnn models is presented in supplementary material results we developed a deep learning model using ganbased augmentation in the challenging context of pharyngitis detection to build a balanced training dataset the cyclegan models generated normal and pathologic throat images using the initial training dataset the color intensity distributions of the pharyngitis and normal throat images were not significantly different although most throat images had exudate regions fig a the tsne algorithm demonstrates that both groups are clustered and they are separable by a considerable margin fig b the final cyclegan model for the pharyngitis throat image was trained for epochs which required h after training normal throat images were translated into pathologic images and throat images with pharyngitis were translated into normal images finally we constructed a balanced augmented training dataset including normal and pharyngitis images using cyclegan the cycleganbased synthetic images were realistic and reflected the characteristic features of pharyngitis fig a the cyclegan model synthesized white or gray patches and increased the redness on the throat wall and tonsils from normal images fig b generated throat images were reviewed by three clinicians including an otolaryngologist and an anesthesiologist all pharyngitis images generated were deemed by the three clinicians to show \\u00e2 more pathologic and inflammatory\\u00e2 results when compared to the original images this feature generation based on the cyclegan model can be effective for generating a new sample to increase the intra class variation and generalizability the cnn models were trained using the final augmented dataset via the transfer learning technique fig demonstrates the training process of the resnet cnn model using the training and validation sets the training process for cnn took approximately h for epochs with finetuning for each training step after the th epoch the validation accuracy was not improved and the crossentropy of the validation result increased therefore we considered that training for epochs was optimal in the resnet model and selected the trained model at the th epoch fig a shows the training validation and test datasets of cnn models with and without cycleganbased augmentation the rocaucs of resnet inceptionv and mobilenetv without gan based augmentation were and respectively fig b we obtained the best rocauc of pharyngitis detection using resnet with ganbased augmentation corresponding to fig c at the optimal diagnostic cutoff value the resnet model predicted pharyngitis with an accuracy of sensitivity of and specificity of the rocauc of inceptionv and mobilenetv corresponded to and respectively the models with gan based augmentation demonstrated superior performance in comparison with the models with only basic augmentation we also evaluated the performance of the models using prcs fig the prcauc also demonstrated that deep learning models with ganbased augmentation had better performance than those without ganbased augmentation resnet with ganbased augmentation predicted pharyngitis with the highest prcauc of when a custom deep learning network without the transfer learning technique was trained the validation accuracy was lower than and was not improved during the training epochs supplementary materials table shows the performance of cnn models via fold cross validation in the entire dataset a similar tendency is observed for the average accuracy and auc values in the crossvalidation the result shows that the highest detection accuracy and rocauc achieved were and respectively by using the resnet other cnn models showed lower performance than the resnet with ganbased augmentation but there were no significant differences between cnn models in the fold crossvalidation a saliency map using the grad cam technique was generated to visualize the characteristic pathologic features of pharyngitis for the predicted evidence fig a in normal throat images however some regions were highlighted fig b when synthesized images were tested using the trained model synthesized exudates were highlighted correctly in the images as

the trained gan models were able to generate new realistic synthetic throat images which can improve the diagnostic accuracy the final deep learning model achieves high accuracy for automated diagnosis of pharyngitis using smartphone images therefore this framework could be targeted toward patients with a sore throat who need screening for severe pharyngitis we believe that our study could be extended to computeraided diagnosis using images from an endoscope system in otolaryngology clinics similar to what has been done with colonoscope images using a deep learning model to the best of our knowledge no study has been performed to detect pharyngitis based on deep learning using smartphone images however it should be noted that this study is considered as only a preliminary and proofofconcept study because of its technical limitations due to using only google colab the current study framework is similar to that of chamier which showed a deep learning framework using google drive and training and prediction on google colab our proposed conceptual workflow is shown in fig it needs the flask servers and interfaces implemented using html and javascript to be applied in a real clinical setting this work could be part of a larger project to enable smartphonebased pharyngitis detection via a cloudbased applevel mobile data analysis we believe that a future appbased model can provide a robust solution for the costeffective and convenient screening of pharyngitis in a telemedicine setting we have highlighted the feasibility of a smartphonebased approach with deep learning to detect pharyngitis our approach does not require fig classification results from the deep learning model applied to clinical cases with severe pharyngitis a an yearold man with odynophagia b a yearold diabetic man with throat pain fig example of a proposed smartphonebased system for pharyngitis detection computersinbiologyandmedicine cexplored clinical datasets and webbased datasets and showed that the labeling of webbased images is often uncertain therefore further clinical datasets with validation will be required to confirm the effectiveness of our framework fourth because we collected only throat images via image search engines there was no metadata including gender race season or age according to a previous epidemiologic study these factors could affect the pharyngitis detection performance fifth although the datasets were reviewed by authors images could be potentially duplicated in the dataset the duplicated images would affect the independence of the validation dataset we have shown the feasibility of deep learning for the detection of tonsil swelling and exudates in throat images the limitations of our study should be overcome by the availability of a sufficient number of throat images taken by a smartphone with a wellanized study protocol to validate the effectiveness of our framework a prospective study with many patients should be performed in a clinic once the app based framework is developed this will solve the problem of possible duplicated images in the dataset and the absence of metadata conclusion tk yoo additional equipment to collect throat images and we collected self taken images using a smartphone the use of webbased image capture of users from various devices and ganbased image augmentation may allow robust image processing while in the current study the implementation was performed on a desktop computer and the colab\\u00e2 s remote server a smartphone application will also be possible to perform this identification for detecting pharyngitis the light deep learning models such as mobilenet can be executed on a smartphone without transmitting the images to a server our result demonstrates that mobilenetv also has a high diagnostic performance similar to resnet and inceptionv in future research an increased amount of training data is needed to improve the detection accuracy using light models the utility of deep learning and smartphones may facilitate the widespread adoption of telemedicine and physical examination platforms via our approach furthermore the presented framework enabled using a smartphone camera and deep learning techniques will help the patients in selfscreening for severe pharyngitis and may accelerate diagnostic support in remote healthcare services because of the recent pandemic of covid patients with respiratory symptoms need selfmonitoring to evaluate their pathologic status advances in technology will require clinicians to embrace remote healthcare services the framework presented in this paper was designed for the timely diagnosis of pharyngitis for treatment similar smartphoneimagebased diagnostic approaches have been introduced in several other medical image domains including skin diseases hematologic diseases oral diseases and eye diseases the main concern of deep learning models in this study \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
